// Section: Terminology
//   The outline of a gear is a smooth circle (the "pitch circle") which has
//   mountains and valleys added so it is toothed.  There is an inner
//   circle (the "root circle") that touches the base of all the teeth, an
//   outer circle that touches the tips of all the teeth, and the invisible
//   pitch circle in between them.  There is also a "base circle", which can
//   be smaller than all three of the others, which controls the shape of
//   the teeth.  The side of each tooth lies on the path that the end of a
//   string would follow if it were wrapped tightly around the base circle,
//   then slowly unwound.  That shape is an "involute", which gives this
//   type of gear its name.


// Section: Functions
//   These functions let the user find the derived dimensions of the gear.
//   A gear fits within a circle of radius outer_radius, and two gears should have
//   their centers separated by the sum of their pitch_radius.

// Section: 3D Gears and Racks


// Function&Module: gear()
// Usage: As a Module
//   gear(pitch|mod, teeth, thickness, <shaft_diam>, <hide>, <pressure_angle>, <clearance>, <backlash>, <helical>, <slices>, <interior>);
// Usage: As a Function
//   vnf = gear(pitch|mod, teeth, thickness, <shaft_diam>, <hide>, <pressure_angle>, <clearance>, <backlash>, <helical>, <slices>, <interior>);
// Description:
//   Creates a (potentially helical) involute spur gear.  The module `gear()` gives an involute spur
//   gear, with reasonable defaults for all the parameters.  Normally, you should just choose the
//   first 4 parameters, and let the rest be default values.  The module `gear()` gives a gear in the
//   XY plane, centered on the origin, with one tooth centered on the positive Y axis.  The
//   most important is `pitch_radius()`, which tells how far apart to space gears that are meshing,
//   and `outer_radius()`, which gives the size of the region filled by the gear.  A gear has a "pitch
//   circle", which is an invisible circle that cuts through the middle of each tooth (though not the
//   exact center). In order for two gears to mesh, their pitch circles should just touch.  So the
//   distance between their centers should be `pitch_radius()` for one, plus `pitch_radius()` for the
//   other, which gives the radii of their pitch circles.  In order for two gears to mesh, they must
//   have the same `pitch` and `pressure_angle` parameters.  `pitch` gives the number of millimeters of arc around
//   the pitch circle covered by one tooth and one space between teeth.  The `pressure_angle` controls how flat or
//   bulged the sides of the teeth are.  Common values include 14.5 degrees and 20 degrees, and
//   occasionally 25.  Though I've seen 28 recommended for plastic gears. Larger numbers bulge out
//   more, giving stronger teeth, so 28 degrees is the default here.  The ratio of `teeth` for two
//   meshing gears gives how many times one will make a full revolution when the the other makes one
//   full revolution.  If the two numbers are coprime (i.e.  are not both divisible by the same number
//   greater than 1), then every tooth on one gear will meet every tooth on the other, for more even
//   wear.  So coprime numbers of teeth are good.
// Arguments:
//   pitch = The circular pitch, or distance between teeth around the pitch circle, in mm.
//   teeth = Total number of teeth around the entire perimeter
//   thickness = Thickness of gear in mm
//   shaft_diam = Diameter of the hole in the center, in mm.  Default: 0 (no shaft hole)
//   hide = Number of teeth to delete to make this only a fraction of a circle
//   pressure_angle = Controls how straight or bulged the tooth sides are. In degrees.
//   clearance = Clearance gap at the bottom of the inter-tooth valleys.
//   backlash = Gap between two meshing teeth, in the direction along the circumference of the pitch circle
//   helical = Teeth rotate this many degrees from bottom of gear to top.  360 makes the gear a screw with each thread going around once.
//   slices = Number of vertical layers to divide gear into.  Useful for refining gears with `helical`.
//   scale = Scale of top of gear compared to bottom.  Useful for making crown gears.
//   interior = If true, create a mask for difference()ing from something else.
//   mod = The metric module/modulus of the gear.
//   anchor = Translate so anchor point is at origin (0,0,0).  See [anchor](attachments.scad#anchor).  Default: `CENTER`
//   spin = Rotate this many degrees around the Z axis after anchor.  See [spin](attachments.scad#spin).  Default: `0`
//   orient = Vector to rotate top towards, after spin.  See [orient](attachments.scad#orient).  Default: `UP`
// Example: Spur Gear
//   gear(pitch=5, teeth=20, thickness=8, shaft_diam=5);
// Example: Metric Gear
//   gear(mod=2, teeth=20, thickness=8, shaft_diam=5);

//   n4 = 20; //orange gear

//   rack(pitch|mod, teeth, thickness, height, <pressure_angle>, <backlash>);
// Usage: As a Function
//   vnf = rack(pitch|mod, teeth, thickness, height, <pressure_angle>, <backlash>);
// Description:
//   This is used to create a 3D rack, which is a linear bar with teeth that a gear can roll along.
//   A rack can mesh with any gear that has the same `pitch` and `pressure_angle`.
//   When called as a function, returns a 3D [VNF](vnf.scad) for the rack.
//   When called as a module, creates a 3D rack shape.
// Arguments:
//   pitch = The circular pitch, or distance between teeth around the pitch circle, in mm. Default: 5
//   teeth = Total number of teeth along the rack.  Default: 20
//   thickness = Thickness of rack in mm (affects each tooth).  Default: 5
//   height = Height of rack in mm, from tooth top to back of rack.  Default: 10
//   pressure_angle = Controls how straight or bulged the tooth sides are. In degrees.  Default: 28
//   backlash = Gap between two meshing teeth, in the direction along the circumference of the pitch circle.  Default: 0
//   clearance = Clearance gap at the bottom of the inter-tooth valleys.
//   mod = The metric module/modulus of the gear.
//   anchor = Translate so anchor point is at origin (0,0,0).  See [anchor](attachments.scad#anchor).  Default: `CENTER`
//   spin = Rotate this many degrees around the Z axis after anchor.  See [spin](attachments.scad#spin).  Default: `0`
//   orient = Vector to rotate top towards, after spin.  See [orient](attachments.scad#orient).  Default: `UP`
// Anchors:
//   "adendum" = At the tips of the teeth, at the center of rack.
//   "adendum-left" = At the tips of the teeth, at the left end of the rack.
//   "adendum-right" = At the tips of the teeth, at the right end of the rack.
//   "adendum-back" = At the tips of the teeth, at the back of the rack.
//   "adendum-front" = At the tips of the teeth, at the front of the rack.
//   "dedendum" = At the base of the teeth, at the center of rack.
//   "dedendum-left" = At the base of the teeth, at the left end of the rack.
//   "dedendum-right" = At the base of the teeth, at the right end of the rack.
//   "dedendum-back" = At the base of the teeth, at the back of the rack.
//   "dedendum-front" = At the base of the teeth, at the front of the rack.
// Example:
//   rack(pitch=5, teeth=10, thickness=5, height=5, pressure_angle=20);
// Example: Metric Rack
//   rack(mod=2, teeth=10, thickness=5, height=5, pressure_angle=20);
